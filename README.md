# Spirea Victor-Radu
## Computatioal Neuroscience/Machine Learning/Interdisciplinary Research of Contemporary Phenomena.
I use this space as a public notebook documenting my work at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning and behavioural analysis.
My projects focus of building reproductible analytical pipelines, simulating neural systems and exploring pharmacological dynamics through computational methods. Alongside technical work, I publish structured behavioral analyses applying cognitive and social psychological theory to contemporarary phenomena, such as pop culture, consumer behaviour, status signaling, fashion trends, and brand dynamics.

## Core Focus Areas
• Brian2 Neural Network Simulations
• Cognitive Mechanism Underlying Perception, Status, and Cultural Adoption
• Neuro-ML Pipelines ( Classification, Feature Selection, and Cross-Validation )
