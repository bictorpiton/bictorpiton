## Computatioal Neuroscience/Machine Learning/Interdisciplinary Research of Contemporary Phenomena.
I use this space as a public notebook documenting my work at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning and behavioural analysis.
My projects focus of building reproductible analytical pipelines, simulating neural systems and exploring pharmacology through computational methods. Alongside technical work, I publish structured behavioral analyses applying cognitive and social psychological theory to contemporarary phenomena, such as pop culture, consumer behaviour, status signaling, fashion trends, and brand dynamics.

## Core Focus Areas:
• Brian2 Neural Network Simulations

• Cognitive Mechanism Underlying Perception, Status, and Cultural Adoption

• Neuro-ML Pipelines ( Classification, Feature Selection, and Cross-Validation )

## About Me:
I am interested in systems, how structured mechanism generate observable behaviour, this applying to neural circuits, social enviorments, and pharmacology.
My background combines medical training, psychology, and computational experimentation. I am drawn to questions that connect theory with implementation. I value precision in thinking equally to creative thinking patterns, independence in learning. My work is self-directed, driven by curiosity, while still having a core rooted in my formal academic training, general medicine.
